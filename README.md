# üöÄ Audio Recorder with ESP32 S3 N16R8 and SD Card in 4-bit SDIO mode.

# *üìú Description*
This project allows recording audio at **16 bits @ 44.1 kHz**, storing the data as raw values in a `.bin` file (not as a standard audio file).
It uses an 4-bit SD card in SDIO mode, ESP32 S3 B16R8, and an audio codec (PMOD I2S2).

## *SD card (SDIO compatible)*
- SD cards are able to work in SDIO 4-bit mode, increasing data transfer compared to SPI mode.
- SD cards can be connected directly to 3V3. SD card adapter can be used in order to utilize micro SD cards in this mode.

- SD Card speeds are often indicated by logos printed on them.
- Audio file size can be calculated with [Audio File Size Calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/audio-file-size).

# *Sketch*
- The sketch is developed using Arduino IDE, allowing comparison of different MCUs without the need to learn new IDEs for each platform. Currently, only ESP MCUs have been tested because I2S with MCLK is not widely supported on other MCU platforms.
- The I2S driver provided by Espressif Systems is unique and not compatible with other platforms.

# *Arduino IDE setup.*
-  PSRAM enabled: OPI PSRAM.
-  Avoid using GPIO 35, 36 and 37 if OPI PSRAM is enabled.
- CPU frequency can be as low as 80 MHz. 
- At 40 MHz wifi won't connect. I2S will halt the system.
#

# *Future releases:*
  - External RTC must be implemented. Time shift while in sleep mode could be as high as 4 mins per day.
  - Check SD capacity left before start recording.
  - Re-define macros for debugging functions such as digitalWrite and and Serial print, also add a datalog.txt.
  - Battery level checker (requires hardware modifications).

# I2S, DMA and PSRAM Buffer size explanation.
```c
  #define MAX_CICLE_COUNT 1000                                  // PSRAM (MAX 8MB / I2S_BUFFERSIZE)  
  #define BUF_COUNT 16                                          // I2S DMA Buffer count.  
  #define BUF_LEN 512                                           // I2S DMA Buffer length.  
  #define I2S_BUFFERSIZE ((BUF_COUNT - 1) * BUF_LEN)            // min. 50 ms 16bits@44.1khz required by SD_MMC.begin()  
  #define PSRAM_BUFFER_SIZE (MAX_CICLE_COUNT * I2S_BUFFERSIZE)  // 7.5 MB max for headroom.  
```
  PSRAM is 8 MB. 8*1024*1024 8-bit bytes.
  Working at 16 bits, it means:
  8*1024*1024 / 44100 (sample rate) / 2 (int in bytes) = ~95 secs of audio at 44.1KHz@16 bits. (1 channel).
  Since C++/ESP IDF/FreeRTOS uses some bytes in the PSRAM, ~7.5 MB  (~87 secs) is the PSRAM Buffer size used.
  
  The DMA peripheral uses BUF_COUNT buffers of BUF_LEN bytes to store I2S data without loading the CPU.
  i2s_channel_read reads all those buffers and saves the amount of bytes passed as a parameter:
```c
  i2s_channel_read(rx_handle, rxbuf, sizeof(rxbuf), &readsize, 1000);
```
  If sizeof(rxbuf) is larger than BUF_COUNT * BUF_LEN, data is lost.
```c
  #define I2S_BUFFERSIZE ((BUF_COUNT - 1) * BUF_LEN) 
```
  provides a small headroom. If the function 
  i2s_channel_read (a blocking function) cannot be called in time, I2S data will overwrite samples.
  Some documentation does not recommend using BUF_LEN > 1024 or 2048.
  BUF_LEN 8 * 1024 could be tested in future board versions.

  Since this hardware is battery-powered, the SD card needs to be shut down most of the time until the PSRAM buffer 
  is almost full. This is why I2S_BUFFERSIZE needs to be large enough to avoid losing samples while the SD
  card initializes (which includes power-on and calling SD_MMC.begin(), which requires ~50 ms).
  I2S_BUFFERSIZE is 16 * 512 / 44100 / 2 = ~92 ms.

  Once the SD card is initialized, data is saved in chunks of 3 KB, which provides the fastest data rate on
  the SD card used. Data is saved every ~80 ms (SD_WRITE_TIMER), which is the time DMA requires to fill the I2S buffers.

  To fill the PSRAM buffer, 1000 cycles are required (512 * 15 * 1000 = 7.32 MB).
  To save all the data to the SD card requires ~54 cycles.
  This is why at cycle no. '1000-4', the SD card is initialized. This value may change in the future.
  The idea is to start saving data before I2S overwrites the first samples in the PSRAM buffer.
  This method keeps the SD card ON only 54 / 1000 = 5% of the time.
  It could be said that most of the system's power consumption comes from the MCU and the PSRAM.
  Selecting a low-power PSRAM might improve power efficiency.
  Selecting a lower-power MCU requires an MCU with all the necessary peripherals (SDIO, I2S, OPI or SPI for the
  PSRAM) and could require a different IDE.
  The values mentioned were either calculated or measured using a specific sketch for this particular hardware.
  Improvements in SD management would not have a significant enough impact to justify further system evaluation.
